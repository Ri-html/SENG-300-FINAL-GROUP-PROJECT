## **Use case:** View and Start a Game

**Primary actor:** User

**Goal in context:** To allow the user to view game details and either start a solo game for points or challenge another user to a multiplayer game.

**Preconditions:** The user's profile and the other user's profile are loaded and displayed.

**Trigger:** The user decides to start or challenge a game.

**Scenario:**
1. User navigates to the "Other's Profile" screen.
2. User clicks the Challenge button next to a specific game (e.g., Chess, Connect 4, Tic Tac Toe).

	- If the game is solo (e.g., for points competition), the user can start playing immediately.
	- If the game requires another user (multiplayer), the system verifies if the user is eligible to challenge for the selected game.

3. For solo games, the game starts, and the user begins playing.
4. For multiplayer games, the system sends a challenge request to the other user.
5. A confirmation message is displayed to the user indicating the challenge has been sent, and the challenged user receives a notification.

**Exceptions**:

1. The user is not eligible to start or challenge for the game (e.g., insufficient ranking or system error). An error message is displayed.
2. The system fails to send the challenge due to a network or server issue. The system notifies the user of the failure and prompts them to try again later.
