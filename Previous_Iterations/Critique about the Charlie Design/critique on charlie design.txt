Overall, the designs are well done and the exceptions are well thought out. Just a few minor points of improvement to better understand the use case process. An usecase of placing pieces on the tictactoe and a return option in tic tac toe home menu would be a nice addition. Tic Tac Toe leaderboard use case is especially well done in outlining its functionality.


	Tic Tac Toe Home Menu description

well done in separating function by components

gives a good outline of the options (leader board, view queue)

cons
missing a way for player to return back to choose game menu if a player decides to not want to play


	Tic Tac Toe game queue

a well formatted description of the process of queueing of the game and waiting for an opponent

cons
recommend first searching the queue for valid opponent before adding the player into the queue

could do better with a bit more emphasis on what the waiting process for the queue would be like would it move the player to the game page with a loading icon like in chess.com, or just a prompt saying waiting for player like in MLBB


	Tic Tac Toe game Instance

good description of the process where players are paired, notified, and the game starts; and the general process of the game where player takes turns making moves to end, system records outcome, and results are displayed, to where players make a decision to return back to homepage.

cons/suggestions
recommends making a separate use case of making the moves or a sequence diagram to get a better understanding of the process of the game as it is pretty complicated


No Match Found

nice outline of the process where game failed to find opponent, displays a pop-up and user is given choices of what to do afterward.

cons/suggestions
could be combined with other No Match Found use case since it does the same thing just with different games


Tic Tac Toe Leaderboard

Clearly outlined the information and statistic shown on the leader board, their function, and option to return back to home page


Checkers Home Menu
clearly defined the process of going into the menu and the two functions inside the menu

cons/recommendations
Suggestion to add a way to return to choose game menu among the options as in tictactoe home menu

Adding that the player has logged into their account is a bit redundant. Could be abstracted to just mention the pages directly before and after the use case
