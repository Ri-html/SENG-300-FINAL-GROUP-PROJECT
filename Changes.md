## Integration Team
Integration team documented changes requested, creating ease for other teams to look through information. Also documented 
the effect on the system, including the amount of work that had to be done and what had to be changed. Team decided to focus 
on rematch system, as both teams recommend it. Chat functionality was deemed unimportant and would likely overstress the system, 
resulting in failure of primary functionality.
